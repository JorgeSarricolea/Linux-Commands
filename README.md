# What is Linux?

##### Linux is a popular operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It has many distributions that have different interfaces for installing software, different user interfaces, etc. One thing that all 'distros' have in common is that they all have a command line interface, or terminal. In fact, sometimes there is no user interface at all except the terminal itself. A Linux server running a web application on AWS, for example, might contain only the software needed to run the application, and no graphical user interface at all. It is crucial to learn the Linux command line if you are going to be a productive Linux user and/or administer a Linux server.
